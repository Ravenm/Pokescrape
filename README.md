it kinda works

## Install ##
---
You will need to either install phantomjs or change to use your webdriver of choice.
If you plan on posting to slack you will need to import slacker.
You will also need urlparse in order to strip down.

## General usage ##
---
Check that the above is installed.
Set your ignorefile to prevent notifications about rattatas.
Set the timer and loop count to whatever values you find appropriate.
Set the Markers to be locations that you want to monitor.
Fire it and see what breaks.
After a successful run you should have a log file that you can run AnalizeIT on to get rough idea of what has spawned and where.
If you need to see futher set distance to a larger value.

## Breaks ##
---
Pokevision goes down pretty often right now so don't expect this to work everytime.
